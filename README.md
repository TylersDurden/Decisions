## Text
* Experimenting with reading text, doing spell checking, basic language 
  processing stuff basically. 
  
One of the things I think can be the most fun with a topic like this, is taking
in pretty large sets of data (an entire novel for example) and seeing how small
changes to the code (like 6 lines or so as shown in this image) can make the 
program significantly more powerful in achieving it's goal.

## Visual
Genetic Walks - Improve random walks with a Genetic Algorithm approach
where each walk is a parent/child, and the random steps are like dna to be
mutated and inhered/selected for

### Ants
* Doing some random walk, and random walk related, simulations 
### Probably
* Visually centered problems that are based on either data easily made visual, 
  or by data that is intrinsically visual.

## Poker
* Pretty straightforward in principle, but trying to also do this
  as somewhat of an OOP excercise so progress is slow.
